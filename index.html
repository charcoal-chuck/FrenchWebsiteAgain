							<p>
								What is France all about?
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							France, officially the French Republic, is a country primarily located in Western Europe, consisting of metropolitan France and several overseas regions and territories.
							The metropolitan area of France extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea.
							The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.
							France is the largest country in the EU, stretching from the North Sea to the Mediterranean.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							The landscape is diverse, with mountains in the east and south, including the Alpine peak of Mont Blanc (4 810 m) which is western Europe's highest point.
							Lowland France consists of four river basins, the Seine in the north, the Loire and the Garonne flowing westwards and the Rhône, which flows from Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean Sea.
							The president of the Republic has an important political role. He chairs the meetings of the Council of Ministers (cabinet), and retains overall responsibility in key areas of foreign affairs and defence.
							The day-to-day running of the country is in the hands of the prime minister. The president is elected by direct popular vote for a period of five years.
							The parliament consists of a National Assembly, directly elected every five years, and a Senate whose members are chosen by an electoral college.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							France has an advanced industrial economy and an efficient farm sector. Main activities include automobile manufacture, aerospace, information technology, electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals and fashion.
							France has produced some of the continent's most influential writers and thinkers from Descartes and Pascal in the 17th century, to Rousseau and Voltaire in the 18th, Balzac, Baudelaire and Flaubert in the 19th and Sartre and Camus in the 20th.
							In the last two centuries it has given the art world the works of Renoir, Monet, Cezanne, Gauguin, Matisse and Braque, to name but a few.
							French cuisine is one of the finest in Europe; cooking and eating are part of French culture and lifestyle.

									<h3><a href="#">Emmanuel Macron</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Born in 1977 in northern France, Emmanuel Macron attended a series of elite schools before joining the French Finance Ministry in 2004.
									Following a four-year stint at an investment bank, he joined President François Hollande's staff in 2012, eventually becoming minister of economy, industry and digital data.
								</p>
								<p>
									After forming the centrist En Marche! party in 2016, Macron became a surprising frontrunner in the presidential race.
									He defeated National Front leader Marine Le Pen in May 2017 to become, at age 39, the youngest president in French history.
								</p>
								<p>
									Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron was born on December 21, 1977, in Amiens, France.
									The eldest child of two doctors, Macron distinguished himself with his intellect at an early age, displaying an aptitude for literature, politics and theater.
								</p>
								<p>
									After attending the local Jesuit school La Providence, Macron completed his high school education at the prestigious Lycée Henri IV in Paris.
									He went on to study philosophy at Nanterre University and public affairs at Sciences Po, before graduating from the elite École Nationale d’Administration (ENA) in 2004.

									<h3><a href="#">The Flag</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									As with other nations, France’s flag is highly symbolic of the nation’s core values.
									The meaning of the flag’s colors are deeply rooted in the country’s aristocratic and revolutionary history.
								</p>
								<p>
									Traditional colors of the flag in pre-revolutionary France contained a white background with a blue shield and the gold Fleur-de-lys depicting the royal coat of arms.
								</p>
								<p>
									However, after the French Revolution, the country’s leaders wanted a simpler design that supported the new values of the nation, and the French Tricolour was adopted.
								</p>
								<p>
									White is the traditional color of the House of Bourbon, who ruled in France from the late 16th Century until the French Revolution.
									On the flag, the color white represents the King.
								</p>
								<p>
									The red and blue in the flag represents the city of Paris.
									Revolutionaries in Paris traditionally flew red and blue. Likewise, revolutionaries wore blue and red cockades (ribbons) on their hats when they stormed the Bastille in 1789.
