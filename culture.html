							Most people associate French culture with Paris, which is a center of fashion, cuisine, art and architecture, but life outside of the City of Lights is very different and varies by region.
							France doesn't just have culture; the word "culture" actually comes from France.
							"'Culture' derives from the same French term, which in turn derives from the Latin colere, meaning to tend to the earth and grow, cultivation and nurture," Cristina De Rossi, an anthropologist at Barnet and Southgate College in London, told Live Science.
						</p>
						<p>
							Historically, French culture was influenced by Celtic and Gallo-Roman cultures as well as the Franks, a Germanic tribe.
							France was initially defined as the western area of Germany known as Rhineland but it later came to refer to a territory that was known as Gaul during the Iron Age and Roman era.

								<h3>Languages</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								French is the official language and the first language of 88 percent of the population, according to the BBC.
								It is the dominant language of the country's 70 million residents, but there are a number of variants based on region.
								French is the second most widely learned foreign language in the world, with almost 120 million students, according to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development.
							</p>
							<p>
								About 3 percent of the population speaks German dialects, and there is a small group of Flemish speakers in the northeast, according to the BBC. Arabic is the third-largest minority language.
								Those living near the border of Italy may speak Italian as a second language, and Basque is spoken by people living along the French-Spanish border.
								Other dialects and languages include Catalan, Breton (the Celtic language), Occitan dialects, and languages from the former French colonies, including Kabyle and Antillean Creole.

								<h3>Values</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								The French take immense great pride in their nation and government and are typically offended by any negative comments about their country.
								Visitors, particularly Americans, often interpret their attitude toward foreigners as rude.
								"From around the 16th century, in Europe, culture became a term for the cultivation of the mind, the intellect, knowledge, learning, creative faculties and acceptable ways of behaving," said De Rossi.
							</p>
							<p>
								The French embrace style and sophistication and take pride in the fact that even their public spaces strike a regal tone.
								The French believe in égalité, which means equality, and is part of the country's motto: "Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité."
								Many say they place a higher importance on equality than liberty and fraternity, the other two words in the motto.
								The French embody romance and passion, and there is an open attitude toward sex outside of marriage, according to a study by France's National Research Agency on AIDS.
							</p>
							<p>
								Even the country's top politicians have been known to carry out extramarital affairs without making an effort to conceal them.
								As a reflection of the country's secular nature, it is not uncommon for children are born to unmarried couples.
								In addition to traditional marriage, French couples also have the choice of getting a pacte civil de solidarité (PACS).
								This is a union that has many of the same benefits of marriage, like tax breaks, but can be dissolved with a notice or by marrying someone else or instead of a divorce.
								Two-thirds as many French couples are in a PACS as are married, according to The Economist.
