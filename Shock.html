								Foreigners in France often find the French culture can be tough to navigate at first. It can even shock you at times, in both good ways and bad, but it's always fascinating, explains Rosie McCarthy, the creator of Youtube Channel "Not Even French".
							</p>
							<p>
								Nowadays, thanks to the interweb, preparing psychologically for a move to France involves simply typing “French culture shock” into Google and bingeing away.
							</p>
							<p>
								Here we explore just a handful of the less conventional French culture shocks.
							</p>

									<h3>No matter how cool you are, you’ll find it hard to make friends
									</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									As explained rather thoroughly in this video, French people, in general, are coconuts. Yep, coconuts. Relationship wise, it takes a long time and a lot of repeated attempts to crack through the tough surface and reach that soft, inner coconut flesh.
								</p>
								<p>
									What this means is that conversations stay surface level for a long time, even amongst peers. Let’s put it this way: if you had one euro for every time you found yourself explaining where you live and which mode of transport you take, you wouldn’t need to worry about that permis de travail.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another classic is explaining the travel options you have to get back to your home country, how often you go back and how much that all costs, so be prepared to have that speech nailed in French.
								</p>
								<p>
									At times it feels like an endless loop of fact-based exchanges until you can get into those really deep and meaningful conversations with the French, with true friendships taking sometimes a year or more to form.
								</p>
								<p>
									Additionally, French people tend to keep their friends close throughout their schooling years, all the way from l’école maternelle to la fac.
									What this means is that there are usually strongly established friendship circles by the time you arrive on the scene. It may hurt at first to realize that they don’t need you as a friend as much as you need them. But don't let it put you off.

									<h3>Business meetings may seem chaotic at first (or always)</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Did anyone ever tell you that running effective meetings in France was a little like herding cats? No? Well, now you know.
								</p>
								<p>
									With France being a time-flexible culture, be prepared for meetings to start 10-15 minutes late and run over by at least as much. Perhaps you expect meetings to serve as a forum to talk to specific, pre-defined points on an agenda in order to reach a firm decision or agree on a clear plan of action. You’re going to leave those expectations at the door – they don’t belong here!
								</p>
								<p>
									What you’re likely to experience is that wonderful French passion for debate, discussion and intellectual challenge. The meeting agenda, if it even exists, can (and will) get hijacked at any moment. And boy can that discussion heat up.
								</p>
								<p>
									Students in the French school system are taught to disagree openly (thèse, anti-thèse, synthèse) and hence French business people intuitively follow a similar pattern in meetings. Conflict and confrontation are seen as a way to deconstruct an idea, challenge it to the maximum to see how robust it really is (bringing any risks and contradictions to the forefront), ultimately resulting in an even better idea. If it’s your idea in the firing line, remember: it is not YOU who is being attacked, it is the IDEA, so don’t take it personally.
								</p>
								<p>
									Bear in mind the meeting may end with a simple “et voilà.” No action points. No next steps. No recap of the key decisions taken. Just like that, meeting participants are meant to have understood all of this implicitly.
								</p>
								<p>
									Also bear in mind that any decision taken in the meeting can change depending on who the boss meets in the corridor afterwards or during their next pause-café. At the end of the day, it’s the boss who decides, and they may be inclined to pursue their own personal goals after meetings. Voilà, c’est comme ça.

									<h3>Patience is NOT a virtue</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Impatient locals can be found everywhere, but especially in Paris. Have you ever been made to feel a right hassle? Like you’re unintentionally annoying someone, even if you don’t mean to? You’ll feel that way whenever you use the pedestrian crossing here. Crossing at a designated pedestrian crossing?! How dare thee? Those car and motorbike engines will be revving like thunder and the second you’re out of the way just enough for them not to kill you, they’ll be zooming on past (if they even stop to wait for you at all). You can almost smell their frustration in the burning rubber of their tyres.
								</p>
								<p>
									It doesn’t stop there. Be prepared to hear all the huff, puffs and indignant “oh la la’s” you can imagine whenever there is a 5-10 minute queue at the bank or at the ticket booth down in the Metro.
								</p>
								<p>
									There’s nothing quite like it, except maybe when that iconic SNCF music chimes and they announce that the TGV is running 15 minutes late – it’s like an orchestral piece of melodic, long exhales, sharp inhales and curses, aptly named ‘Le sigh.’
